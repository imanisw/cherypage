       <left><p>Haiti is recognized for its rich culture, distinctive art, and delicious food for centuries. Haitian who migrated to the United States for insecurity and economic reason are grounded as they struggle to preserve their identities which is the soul of their existence. New York is known for the second largest Haitian community in the United States, where Haitian immigrants fleeing Francois Duvalier’s dictatorship from the 1960s to recent past years, had difficulties imposing their arts into the market which is controlled by white male painters for years. Haitian American painters who live in New York for decades are one of the samples.</p></left>
