                            <p>Nathalie Jolivert is a New York City–based architectural designer and artist who grew up in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. As a painter, she participated in a travel art residency to Bangladesh and Malawi which led to an exhibition of her textiles piece Roots of Development at the Frontiers in Development Forum in Washington, DC (2014). Jolivert's design process is often inspired by local stories, which she incorporates throughout her architectural and art projects. (Jolivert's bio). </p>

        <p>Haiti is recognized for its rich culture, distinctive art, and delicious food for centuries. Haitian who migrated to the United States for insecurity and economic reason are grounded as they struggle to preserve their identities which is the soul of their existence. New York is known for the second largest Haitian community in the United States, where Haitian immigrants fleeing Francois Duvalier’s dictatorship from the 1960s to recent past years, had difficulties imposing their arts into the market which is controlled by white male painters for years. Haitian American painters who live in New York for decades are one of the samples.</p>

            <p>When I was in residency in Harlem, they wanted to put a text next to my arts and I asked why, and they told me no one will understand my painting without a text explaining it because it reflected Haitian painting. But I fought for it, and I said if they put for me, they should put for other artists, it hasn’t happened to only me, other artists in the same generation as me, fought for it too. And we kept everything as it should be, but it took time for people to accept it. Says Vladimir Cybil Charlier who is painting for 27 years. I have started to take a series of portraits and interviews over the past months to know how Haitian American struggle to preserve their identity while they adapt to a new culture.</p>

                            <p> Bob Marley as the spirit of plants and of forest, Loko. “LoKo Marley” is part of the Pantéon series which reenact both religious and historical narratives as African-American he/sheroes are cast as the various Spirits/Gods of African derived religions of the Caribbean such as Vodou and Santeria. As these religions were historically banned and had to go “underground” both in colonial and post-colonial societies, mass-produced images of saints were used as a decoy to represent the various Gods, a practice that is still alive today.

                        <p>Mirroring her personal trajectory, Vladimir Cybil Charlier’s work engages the complex cultural dynamics linking The Caribbean and The United States and how these are manifested within the physical space her art practice inhabits. Born in New York City of Haitian parents. Cybil attended school in Haiti spending her summers in New York, a ‘reverse’ immigration trip that still continually informs her practice.</p>
